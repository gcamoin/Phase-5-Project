## Book Review App - Book Buddy



## Description
Book Buddy is an all in one application for all the book worms out there. Book Buddy allows user to browse through
various genres of books and leave reviews on books they have read as well as see reviews other users have left.
Once a user has left a review on a book they have read, it will automatically be added to their list of "mybooks" to help users
keep track of every single read. Users also have the ability to create a new genre as well as a new book if it is not already in the 
database.
